# Solo Squash

This is a simple hardware video game that I'm developing as a possible
student submission for the [Zero to ASIC course](https://zerotoasiccourse.com/).

It is a Verilog HDL project that implements a primitive digital-logic-based
video game that resembles Pong, but with one player just bouncing a ball
within a 3-walled space, resembling a game of
[squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)) but with just 1 paddle.

# Details

This is intended to drive a VGA display at 640x480 resolution, ~60Hz.

It has been tested on a DE0-Nano FPGA board (Altera Cyclone IV),
and I hope to submit this as part of the Google Skywater project to
be made into an ASIC.

An older, more-compact version has also been tested on an XC9572XL CPLD,
but it's a tight fit!
